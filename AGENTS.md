# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this project. This is the cross-tool
entry point: Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Aider, Zed, Windsurf, and
others read `AGENTS.md`. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, which imports this file, so
there is a single source of truth.

## What this is

legirag ("Legirag") is a French legal AI agent: given a legal question in
plain French, it identifies the relevant code(s), unfolds the graph of
cross-references between articles and codes, dates each text, cites the precise
article, and states explicitly what it cannot cover. Corpus: the 73 French legal
codes in force, open data. See `0-BRIEF-PRESTATAIRE.md` for the full brief.

This project is built with the **AI Blueprint**, a workflow layer, not an
app skeleton. To start a new project, scaffold the app first in an empty folder
(create-next-app, Vite, etc.), then overlay these files on top. Never run a
framework scaffolder inside a directory that already holds the blueprint files
(`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `blueprint/`); it fails
because the directory isn't empty.

New here? `blueprint/README.md` explains the whole Blueprint workflow.

## Read these for full context

- `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` - the project's source of truth
- `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` - conventions to follow
- `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` - how to work with the user on this project
- `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` - the one feature, fix, or rollback being built right now

## Workflow

Build one feature, fix, or rollback at a time, behind review gates. Each step's instructions
are plain markdown skills any capable agent can read and follow. The workflow is
exposed through tool-specific adapters:

- Codex: `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`

Unused adapters can be removed. Codex-only projects can delete `CLAUDE.md` and
`.claude/`. Claude Code-only projects can delete `.agents/`, but should keep
`AGENTS.md` because `CLAUDE.md` imports it.

When changing shared workflow behavior, update the matching skill in both
adapter folders so Codex and Claude Code stay aligned.

Core skills:

- `onboard` - tune commands, standards, visibility, ignore rules, and tool adapters after overlaying the Blueprint onto a freshly scaffolded or early project
- `doctor` - read-only Blueprint health check for setup, adapters, plans, overview freshness, and workflow drift
- `adopt` - bootstrap the Blueprint into an existing brownfield app with shipped features
- `overview` - distill the two planning docs into `blueprint/context/project-overview.md`
- `brief` - read-only briefing on an upcoming build-plan feature (scope, dependencies, size) before you spec it
- `feature` - turn a build-plan item into a spec, or propose a reviewed plan addition for a genuinely new feature
- `fix` - document an ad-hoc bug or change into `blueprint/context/current-feature.md`
- `tests` - add or normalize unit testing and turn on the test gate
- `ci` - explicitly set up one project-specific Verify command and matching automatic GitHub checks
- `implement` - build the current spec one small, reviewed step at a time
- `check` - prove the current spec against the running app
- `try` - read-only manual review guide: where to go, what to click, what to expect
- `audit` - branch-aware or full-project review for code quality, security, performance, tests, and standards drift; records findings with durable IDs and statuses in `blueprint/context/findings.md`, where open or fixed P0/P1 findings block `complete`
- `rollback` - plan a safe reversal of a completed feature from its archive and exact git commit, with later-dependency review before code changes
- `complete` - run the final safety pass, log features, fixes, or rollbacks under `blueprint/history/`, then merge with approval
- `release` - optional Render or Vercel deployment readiness, local config, env review, and smoke-test planning
- `prototype` - optional, pre-build static mockups to lock the look
- `status` - read-only progress summary, workflow drift warning, and suggested next action

In Codex, invoke these as skills (`$onboard`, `$overview`, `$feature`,
`$implement`, and so on) or ask naturally, such as "run the overview." In Claude
Code, use the slash commands (`/onboard`, `/overview`, `/feature`, and so on). In
tools without native skills, follow the matching `SKILL.md` manually. The
conventions in `blueprint/context/` apply however a step is invoked.

Optional explicit-only skill: `autopilot` can run one bounded spec/build/check
and targeted-audit pass when directly invoked. It may create checkpoint commits
on the feature or fix branch after passing steps, repair confirmed P0/P1 findings
within scope, and rerun affected checks. It stops before `/complete`, merge, push,
deploy, or destructive actions.

Deployment is also explicit. `/release` can prepare local Render or Vercel config
and run readiness checks, but it must stop before deploy, remote service changes,
push, or publish unless the user gives a separate yes in the current chat.

## Automatic verification

Automatic GitHub checks are a separate explicit setup. `/onboard` and `/adopt`
only report existing checks and point to `/ci` or `$ci` when none exist. Running
`/ci` inspects the real project and defines one `Verify` command from checks that
already exist. Use this order when available: typecheck, tests, then build. Never
invent a test runner or another check just to fill the command.

For JavaScript and TypeScript projects, prefer a package script such as `verify`
and use the detected package manager. For other stacks, use the native task
runner or exact combined command. Record the exact command under Commands below.

The optional `.github/workflows/verify.yml` must run that same command for pull
requests and pushes to the default branch. Preserve existing workflows, use the
project's real runtime and install command, and grant only `contents: read` by
default. This setup does not add local git hooks, coverage, browser tests,
security scans, or version matrices. Those remain later project choices.

GitHub branch protection or a ruleset can require the check after the repository
is pushed, but that is a separate remote setting. Missing automatic GitHub
checks do not make the Blueprint unusable.

## Commands

TypeScript monorepo (pnpm workspaces: `packages/*`). No dev server yet - `web`
(Next.js, DSFR-inspired UI, planned) and `api` (NestJS, planned) are still stubs.

- Build: `pnpm build`
- Lint: `pnpm lint`
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
- Test: `pnpm test` (Vitest, runs `packages/*/src/**/*.test.ts`)

Testing is already configured with real tests (`packages/shared/src/*.test.ts`),
so it is a gate for logic-bearing build steps. GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) already runs lint, typecheck, and test on every PR
and push to `main`. Run `/ci` or `$ci` if you want these combined into one
documented `Verify` command.
